PREREQUISITES
To compile the DELTA tools and use them to build new DELTA Experiments you need the following:

	-Java 8 JDK by Oracle
	-Android SDK with the following modules installed:
		-SDK Platform v22
		-Android SDK Platform-tools v22 
		-Android SDK Build-tools v25.0.0
		-Android Support Repository
		

CONFIGURING PATHS
Before you can start to build experiments, the project needs to know the path to your AndroidSDK installation. There are two ways to achieve this:
	1)Set the ANDROID_HOME environmental variable to the root of your AndroidSDK installation
	2)Create a "local.properties" file inside the "DELTA.Android" folder and put the following line in it:
		sdk.home=/path/to/your/androidSDK/installation

This should be enough to allow you to use the DELTA Tools and build your experiments.


BUILDING THE TOOLS
Run the bash script "DELTA_*.sh" and use it to build the desktoptools.
If no errors occur the DELTA Desktop Tools have been compiled correctly into the bin/ directory. You can use the same script to launch the Experiment Maker tool and start to create your experiments! Happy logging!
