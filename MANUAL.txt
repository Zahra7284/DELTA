PREREQUISITES
To compile the DELTA tools and use them to build new DELTA Experiments you need the following:

	-Java 7 JDK by Oracle
	-Android SDK with the following modules installed:
		-SDK Platform v22
		-Android SDK Platform-tools v22 
		-Android SDK Build-tools v22.0.1
		-Android Support Repository
		
Important note: version 7 (not 8!) of the JDK is required, due to limitations of the Android SDK, which at present can only work with the JDK7 libraries. 


CONFIGURING PATHS
Before you can start to build experiments, the project needs to know the path to your AndroidSDK installation. There are two ways to achieve this:
	1)Set the ANDROID_HOME environmental variable to the root of your AndroidSDK installation
	2)Create a "local.properties" file inside the "DELTA.Android" folder and put the following line in it:
		sdk.home=/path/to/your/androidSDK/installation

This should be enough to allow you to use the DELTA Tools and build your experiments.


BUILDING THE TOOLS
Run the bash script "DELTA_*.sh" and use it to build the desktoptools.
If no errors occur the DELTA Desktop Tools have been compiled correctly into the bin/ directory. You can use the same script to launch the Experiment Maker tool and start to create your experiments! Happy logging!
